# Release: v0.2.1 (Alpha)

Date: 2025-09-03

Status: Alpha (not production-ready). API and behaviors may change.

Highlights

- CLI: save/retrieve with `${VAR:-default}` interpolation; VS Code tasks.
- Storage: Markdown chunks + JSON index (newest-first).
- Safety: read-only mode, `--dry-run`, write lock.
- Retention: keep newest N chunks and/or prune by age.
- Tooling: pytest (≥85% coverage), ruff lint/format, Makefile.
- CI: tests (3.10–3.13), lint, commit message and PR title checks.
- Docs: README, MkDocs site, ADRs, Governance, Security, Local validation guide.

Breaking Changes

- None (new alpha features).

Bug Fixes (since previous internal iteration)

- Ensure lockfile is cleaned after writes.
- CLI handles empty stdin with explicit error.

Security Fixes

- Added basic write lock to prevent concurrent write corruption.
- Introduced read-only flag and `--dry-run` to avoid accidental writes to real data.

Known Issues

- See `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` for details (no full-text search; plaintext history; network FS locking caveats; Windows lock behavior unvalidated).

Security Advisories

- See `SECURITY_ADVISORIES.md` (no known CVEs at this time).

Upgrade Notes

- Fresh install is recommended. If migrating an older folder, back up `chat_history_index.json` and chunks before enabling retention.

Validation

- Local: `make test`, `make e2e`, and `make smoke-staging`.
- Docs: `make docs-serve` to review documentation locally.

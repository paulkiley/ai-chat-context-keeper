- Source of feedback: #gitops-paved-road channel, office hours, PR comments.
- Triage: platform-team reviews weekly; clusters issues into noise/perf/gaps.

- Review: ARB reviews Proposed ADRs weekly; outcomes recorded in ADR Status.
- Rollout: small PRs to adjust guardrails; measure impact against SLOs.
